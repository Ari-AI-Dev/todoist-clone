# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

Since the GitHub CLI is not available, follow these steps to create and link your repository:

## Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub
1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right and select "New repository"
3. Fill in the repository details:
   - **Repository name**: `todoist-clone`
   - **Description**: `A modern Todoist-style todo application built with React, Convex, and Tailwind CSS`
   - **Visibility**: Public (recommended) or Private
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)

## Step 2: Link Local Repository to GitHub
After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Use these in your terminal:

```bash
# Navigate to your project (if not already there)
cd /Users/ari/Desktop/Development/todoist-clone

# Add the GitHub repository as remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/todoist-clone.git

# Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Verify Setup
Your repository should now be live at:
`https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/todoist-clone`

## What's Already Done ✅
- ✅ Git repository initialized
- ✅ Comprehensive .gitignore file created
- ✅ All project files committed with descriptive commit message
- ✅ Ready to push to GitHub

## Repository Features
Your repository will include:
- Complete React + Vite frontend
- Convex backend with real-time database
- Tailwind CSS styling
- Comprehensive documentation (README.md, SETUP.md)
- Proper .gitignore for Node.js/React projects
- Professional commit history

## Next Steps After GitHub Setup
1. Add repository URL to your README
2. Consider adding GitHub Actions for CI/CD
3. Set up branch protection rules
4. Add collaborators if needed
